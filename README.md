# gatsby-starter-zero

A slimmer Gatsby starter.

Get [`gatsby`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby):

```sh
npm install -g gatsby
```

Get started with this starter:

```sh
gatsby new my-simple-site gh:chbrown/gatsby-starter-zero
```

Go forth and develop!

```sh
cd my-simple-site
gatsby develop
```

When it's all ready:

```sh
gatsby build
```

## Explanation

* `.gitignore`: not required, but the `gatsby` command isn't exactly tidy, so it's handy to have these defaults.
* `config.toml`: bafflingly, this file's presence is required, but it doesn't have to contain anything.
* `html.js`: should be called `Layout.jsx` or something but yeah, it's required, and has to have this filename.
* `package.json`: required, but `gatsby` the dependency transitively pulls in `react` and `react-dom`.
* `README.md`: not required!
* `pages/`: each file in here will be served as a distinct URL. E.g., `pages/admin.js` would go under `/admin/`
